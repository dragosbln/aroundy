# Aroundy

## Description

This is a mobile application for managing employees' vacations. It supports 3 types of users: emplyee, Project Manager and HR. Thus, it offers and end-to-end solution to get rid of the hassle of spreadsheets and 20th-century paper based tracking systems. The applications runs on both Android and iOS devices.
I developed this app during the 2019 summer internship, at Around25. The app was designed by a professional designer, and I worked together with an experienced software developer, that developed the backend of the app.

...but, what if you don't have an account?!
Well, you need a good friend among the company's HR team, because they're the only ones that can create an account for you.

Here, you have a list of all the upcoming National Holidays, along with a countdown to the holiday you selected (Christmas, by default).

You can check your profile and see a countdown to the next free day (holiday or accepted vacation request). Also, your requests history is available.

And that's it!

But wait...

What happens to the request, next?

It goes immediately to your designated PMs and to the HR department!

Here's how the PM home screen looks like:

The PMs will have all the options of a regular employee, plus an extra option: the "My Team" screen, where they can get reports and filter them however much they want!

Of course, we can't forget about our beloved...

### HR department!

They will have all the options of a PM, plus an extra option: the "Manage Users" screen, where they can delete, add, modify users, or log in directly to any account in the database!
